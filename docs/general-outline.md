# General outline


## Intro

Welcome to the inaugural NYC HTML5 podcast. You can find out more about NYCHTML5 by adding a dot com to it. We also have an IRC channel -- Come talk to us!

I am Joe Sepi and I am here with my fellow organizer and spiritual advisor, John Paul (hi everybody).

We are also joined by this month’s speakers, so let’s go around the table and get some introductions. Tell us your name, where you do your thing, what you do there and take a moment to tell us a little bit about your talk


#### To get things started?  
What got you started along the path of learning what you shared with us during the talk? Let’s start with you, Shefali.


## Question Bank:

_questions here, separated based on speaker


## Nearing end

To wrap things up, let’s go around the table and tell our audience what are the takeaway points from your talk? Give us 2-3 bullet points that someone should walk away with after having viewed your presentation?


## Outro

That concludes our broadcast. (Flags waving and the national anthem playing?) I want to thank my fellow organizer and host, as well as our guests. Thanks to you listening or watching at home or wherever you are. You can find out more about our group at nychtml5.com. Tune in next time
