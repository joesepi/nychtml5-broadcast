## Intro

Welcome to the second NYC HTML5 podcast. You can find out more about NYCHTML5 by adding a dot com to it. We also have an IRC channel -- Come talk to us!

I am joe Sepi and I am here with my fellow organizer and spiritual advisor, John Paul (hi).

We are also joined by last month’s speakers, so let’s go around the table and get some introductions. Tell us your name, where you do your thing, what you do there and take a moment to tell us a little bit about your talk.

#### To get things started?
What got you started along the path of learning what you shared with us during the talk? 


## Question Bank:

HTTP - Cory Forsyth
- What are some of the reasons that the average developer should be aware of how HTTP works?
- Can small-batch HTTP requests really be considered artisanal?
- Did HTTP officially come out? You mentioned it would come out int he fall.
- What sort of transitions need to happen for the whole of the internet to be HTTP2 (Browsers? Servers? Code? Asset approaches?)

ACCESSIBILITY - Estella Madison
- Who are we considering when using these aria accessibility aspects? I ask in the video, but I think it is good to go over that for the sake of the broadcast.
- Maybe a quick screenshare demo of an example screenreader working on a bad page and a good page?
- What about the laws around accessibility?
- There was a question about internationalization. Did you investigate that further?
- What was the motivation for your accessibility efforts?

SVG SPRITES - Cody Landstrom
- What got you into svg sprites?
- How common are svg sprites?

DSL - Cameron Edwards
- chit chat


## Nearing end

To wrap things up, let’s go around the table and tell our audience what are the takeaway points from your talk? Give us 2-3 bullet points that someone should walk away with after having viewed your presentation?


## Outro

That concludes our broadcast. (Flags waving and the national anthem playing?) I want to thank my fellow organizers and our guests. Thanks to you listening or watching at home or wherever you are. You can find out more about our group at nychtml5.com. Tune in next time.
