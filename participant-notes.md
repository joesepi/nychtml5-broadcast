# Participant notes

## Before the broadcast

* Close all other unnecessary apps and pages - they could cause annoying noises as well as give you memory issues
* You may want to be aware of your background and it is best to have a light source in front of you and not behind you. We want you to look your best. ;)

## During the broadcast

* Using a headset with a mic can be a good way to go, but it also has the potential to create feedback or an echo. Definitely test it out during the pre game warmup.
* Find the chat icon in the Hangouts sidebar and enable it (will show up as a sidebar on the right side of screen)

## Special tips

* `CMD+d` will mute/unmute your mic in Hangouts on Mac More shortcuts  
This is actually really useful. Participants should be muted unless they are going to talk because if your chair squeeks or something little noise is made, the camera shifts to you when your mic is on. It works best if everyone has the `CMD+d` shortcut at the ready and can chime in like that. Like on a CB radio or a walkee talkee. ;)
